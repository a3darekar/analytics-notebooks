# analytics-notebooks
Jupyter notebooks for demonstration of data analytics using python

This is where I will be posting everything I learn about data analytics and data science in the form of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://ipython.org/notebook.html)

Please watch or star the repository to follow along with me if you are interested in learning data science with me, as I try to upload one or two notebooks every week.

Please provide feedback in case suggestions or issues on my [email](mailto:darekar.amey@gmail.com).

### Index:

1. [Basics](https://github.com/knowhere1998/analytics-notebooks/tree/master/1%20-%20basics)  
	1.1 Learn basics of python libraries - pandas and numpy  
	1.2 Performing statistical analysis on data to find statistical measures like central tendencies, percentiles.  
	1.3 Probabilistic analysis like Probability distribution functions, Corelation, Covariation.  

2. [Visualization](https://github.com/knowhere1998/analytics-notebooks/tree/master/2%20-%20visualizations)  
	2.1 MatplotLib Demonstration with examples of Line Graph, Pie Chart, Bar Graph, Histogram, Boxplot.  
	2.2 Histogram and Boxplot - Use of iris database to visualize histogram and boxplot using pandas, numpy and MatplotLib  

3. [Predictive Models using Regression](https://github.com/knowhere1998/analytics-notebooks/tree/master/3%20-%20regression)  
	3.1 Linear Regression  
	3.2 Polynomial Regression  

### How to get started:

- Clone the repository to your system

```
git clone https://github.com/knowhere1998/analytics-notebooks/

```

- Create a [Virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)(optional but recommended)


	for Python 2:
	```
	
		$ virtualenv env
	```
	for Python 3

	```
	
		$ python3 -m venv env

	```

- activate your virtual environment.

```

	source env/bin/activate

```

You can use [anaconda/conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) to initialize virtual environment instead of forementioned steps  


- install all requirements using pip

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

- run jupyeter server

```
jupyter notebook

```
